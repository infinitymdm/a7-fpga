# A7-FPGA

This repository contains experiments with the Digilient Arty A7 FPGA development board.

The eventual goal is to synthesize and run Core-V Wally with a fully open-source flow, using [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [Project X-Ray](https://github.com/f4pga/prjxray), and [nextpnr-xilinx](https://github.com/gatecat/nextpnr-xilinx).
